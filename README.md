# Poudre_Water_Quality_Intro

This is the repository for the investigation on Northern Water's water quality public database for Colorado State University's ESS 580A9 course; Environmental Data Science Applications: Water Resources. 

The purpose of the research is to become familiar with Northern Water's public data sets and to develop QA/QC best practices. 

This will be done by:
1) Creating scripts and functions to clean data
2) Performing quality control analysis
3) Spatial mapping of data to place research in context
